# alexandria-tests
Integration tests for [alexandria-db](https://github.com/JDSeiler/alexandria-db), which is a database
api for a personal-use project of mine. Details about this project will be added as it develops.

## Plan
1. Finish writing tests for all endpoints as the exist.
   Only routes exist at the moment, so tests will only checking HTTP status codes.
2. With tests in place, refactor endpoint routes to better match REST principles.
3. Write fully fleshed out tests for book#getById() and reading#getById().
   alexandria-db will need to be developed to satisfy these tests.
   
   
The plan will be re-evaluated when those steps are completed.
